> _A prototype scaffolding tool_

# TODO

- [ ] What are the most common build tools for each project? (Browserify, SystemJS, Webpack, etc.)
- [ ] What are the most common tools used for each project? (Linters, Tests, etc.)
- [ ] Need a good way to swap in/out build tools
- [ ] Better way to dynamically build webpack configs (build the config dynamically)
- [ ] Should there just be multiple different types of projects, each one for different build setup etc.?
